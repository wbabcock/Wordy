# Wordy
A word puzzle game for DOS

Wordy is a word puzzle game for DOS. You have six attempts to guess the mystery five-letter word.
After each guess, the game highlights your letters:
black if that letter does not exist in the mystery word,
orange if the letter exists but not in that location,
green if the letter exists in that location.

This is a FreePascal version of Jim Hall's C version of Worldy: https://github.com/freedosproject/wordy
